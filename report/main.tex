\section{Introduction}

For a long period of time in the field of quantum physics it was assumed that the phase of a quantum state was physically irrelevant. The standard argument goes that all measurements in the quantum mechanical realm can be modelled as Hermitian operators, which in turn have a spectral decomposition (that is they can be represented as a linear combination of projectors) which are in turn gauge-invariant with respect to gauge transformation of the type:
